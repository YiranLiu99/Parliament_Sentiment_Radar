## Parliament Sentiment Radar

"Parliament Sentiment Radar", comprised of two components: a Java-based server component and a JavaScript-based client component utilizing SB Admin 2. These components together form an application designed to:

1. Read debates from the German Bundestag in XML format.
2. Analyze, process, and store parliamentary speeches in a database.
3. Utilize specified NLP techniques to process parliamentary speeches.
4. Enable database-driven querying and analysis of results.
5. Implement a RESTful web service to serve parliamentary speeches to the client component.
6. Develop a visualization component using SB Admin 2.

The server component will be implemented as a RESTful web service using Java Spark, facilitating seamless communication with the client component for querying parliamentary speeches. Testing and documenting of REST queries will be conducted using swagger.io.
